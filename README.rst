TXTFILE
-------

With --mktxt you can output a txt file (TXTPATH) that can be used to feed the information to the app.

The basic structure required in the txt file is as follows:

::

    Album:
    Artist: 
    Release:  
    VVV
    1.TrackName--Start--End
    2.Justatrack--0--2:40"

The first three parameters **Album**, **Artist** and **Release** (Release year) can be placed in any order as long as the keys are the same.

The **"VVV"** indicates that below is the tracklist with the times.

**Track Template:**
(TrackNumber).(TrackName)--(StartTime)--(EndTime)

**Time Template:** [H]:[M]:S.[ms] ([] = optional)

Time Shortcuts
--------------

Instead of times following the given **Time Template** audio2album also accepts:

- "0" - as second 0
- "END" - end of the mp3 file (case-insensitive)

Example:

::
    
    1.WholeMP3--0--END
